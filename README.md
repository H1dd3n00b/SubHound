General Info:
I made this script as a way of automating subdomain reconnaissance, as well as a way for me to practice some basic bash scripting.
This script makes use of other community scripts that are widely available here on GitHub, such as crt.sh, assetfinder, subfinder and many others.
Feel free to take a look at the file and uncomment some lines, but do note that it will take significantly longer for the script to run in that case.
Script has only been fully tested only on Kali linux.

Installation & Usage:
1) git clone https://github.com/H1dd3n00b/SubHound.git
2) cd SubHound/Scripts
3) chmod +x *
4) ./DependenciesInstall.sh
5) Wait for everything to install ...
6) ./SubHound.sh
7) Type in the domain you want to scan for subdomains
8) Follow the script instructions, your terminal screen will be cleared occassionnally, this is intended...
9) Script takes about 1-5 minutes to complete
10) ENJOY!
